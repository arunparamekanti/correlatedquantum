        <p class="lead">The electron, having spin S=1/2, produces a dipolar magnetic field. However, spin and orbital
            magnetic moments of electrons in solids can conspire to produce higher order moments where the leading
            contributions to magnetism arise from quadrupole or octupole moments. One place where our group was the
            first to discover concrete theoretical evidence of octupolar magnetism is in a class of transition metal
            oxides called "double perovskites", in which two different transition metals occupy the two sublattices of a
            cubic crystal. In addition to theory work, we have also collaborated with the experimental group of Bruce
            Gaulin at McMaster University whose experiments first led us down this rabbit hole.</p>

        <p class="lead">
            The study of quantum magnetism has progressed from examining very simple ordered states such as ferromagnets
            and
            antiferromagnets, to valence bond states which feature strong entanglement between pairs of neighboring
            spins,
            to more extended types of quantum entanglement. Quantum spin liquids are magnetic states which feature very
            long-range entanglement and concomitant emergence of unusual excitations such as fractional spin and charge
            excitations as well as emergent "gauge fields" which one usually encounters in the study of high energy
            physics.
            We are examining a variety of such quantum spin liquids uncovering, for example, the first possible example
            of a
            3D quantum spin liquid with a Fermi surface of spinons, and a new mechanism of obtaining chiral spin liquids
            from melting a tetrahedral spin crystal with noncoplanar spins. More broadly, our work in this area also
            focuses
            on the phenomenon of "order by disorder" in frustrated systems, and the interplay of interactions and band
            topology in driving emergent phases at topological quantum critical points.

            Alkali and alkaline earth atoms cooled to nanoKelvin temperatures become quantum degenerate and can exhibit
            unusual phases driven by the interplay of Bose or Fermi quantum statistics and atom-atom interactions. We
            have
            studied a number of issues for cold atoms moving in optical lattices created by laser light, in which atoms
            can
            mimic the phases and dynamics of electrons in solid state crystals. Specifically, we are interested in
            exploring
            novel phases created by the effect of synthetic magnetic fields and spin-orbit coupling as well as
            frustration
            induced by wavefunctions of higher optical lattice bands, and how one might probe such remarkable states
            using
            quench dynamics.
